# Project Description/Outline:
"Heart disease, also referred as cardiovascular diseases, is a broad term used for diseases and conditions affecting the heart and circulatory system. It is a major cause of disability all around the world. Since the heart is amongst the most vital organs of the body, its diseases affect other organs and part of the body as well. There are several different types and forms of heart diseases. The most common ones cause narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, malfunctioning in the valves of the heart, enlargement in the size of heart and several others leading to heart failure and heart attack."[source: https://www.indushealthplus.com/heart-diseases.html]

This dataset contains information related to individuals and their risk factors for heart disease. The data includes demographic information such as age and gender, as well as medical history, lifestyle factors, and symptoms associated with heart disease. The target variable indicates whether an individual has been diagnosed with heart disease or not.

## Column Descriptions:
* **Age**: Age of the individual (years).
* **Gender**: Gender of the individual (Male/Female).
* **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol level in mg/dL.
* **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
* **Heart Rate**: Heart rate in beats per minute.
* **Smoking**: Smoking status (Never/Former/Current).
* **Alcohol Intake**: Alcohol intake frequency (None/Moderate/Heavy).
* **Exercise Hours**: Hours of exercise per week.
* **Family History**: Family history of heart disease (Yes/No).
* **Diabetes**: Diabetes status (Yes/No).
* **Obesity**: Obesity status (Yes/No).
* **Stress Level**: Stress level on a scale of 1 to 10.
* **Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar level in mg/dL.
* **Exercise Induced Angina**: Presence of exercise-induced angina (Yes/No).
* **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced (Typical Angina/Atypical Angina/Non-anginal Pain/Asymptomatic).
* **Heart Disease**: Target variable indicating presence of heart disease (0: No, 1: Yes).

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in the patients health history. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between age, cholesterol, smoking, alcohol intake, exercise, stress and heart disease; analyze the proportion of patients with and without heart disease; as well as other related relationships derived from the data. We will utilize machine learning models, Scikit-learn, Tableau visualizations. We will create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
